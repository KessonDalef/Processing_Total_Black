# Total Black Theme for the Processing Environment

This is just a personal color scheme for the Processing environment I use, and I am sharing since there is no total black theme for Processing (or I couldn't find it).

## Why

I like dark themes but never found one dark enough. Also, I use it to overlay the code of my editor when i do Live Coding. So I thought to share it.

## Installation

### For Processing 3+ only!

#### Dark theme
Just place the theme.txt file in your sketchbook folder

#### Font and font colors in the editor
Locate and replace your preferences.txt file (make first a backup!).

You can locate it by going in the Processing preferences and clicking on the path at the bottom.

Icon set not included (not ready yet). Will share as soon as possible.
